Data Analytics and visualization job simulation by accenture

Task 1: PROJECT UNDERSTANDING

Learn:
1. What are the responsibilities of a Data Analyst at Accenture
2. What is a typical project team structure
3. How to review a client project brief

To do:
1. Meet the Accenture team, including the industry, IPO and data experts
2. Read and analyze a client project brief to understand the client and business problem, identify the requirements that need to be delivered, and identify which tasks you need to focus on as a data analyst.

The role of a Data Analyst is to act as the conduit between the business and the data. The analyst’s work helps the upper management to make strategic business decisions. The client, Social Buzz, is a social media and content creation platform based in San Francisco. As a result of their meteoric growth, they have ended up collecting swathes of data, and want to make well-informed strategic decisions for the future.

As part of a 3-month initial project, the deliverables decided upon are
1. An audit of their big data practice.
2. Recommendations for a successful IPO.
3. An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity. (This is where the Data Analyst is involved)
Once the project requirements and the team have been finalized, it is time to get to work on the Social Buzz data.

Task 2: DATA CLEANING AND MODELLING

learn
How to clean, model and analyze data to create valuable insights for the client.

To do

1.Identify which datasets will be required to answer the client’s business question
2.Clean the datasets and merge them to prepare the data for analysis
3.Determine the answer to the client’s business question

we have,
1. 7 data sets — each data set contains different columns and values
2. A data model — this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.

To make sure that the right data is used to answer the business questions, the steps to be followed are

1. Requirements gathering
2. Data cleaning
3. Data modelling

As part of the Requirements Gathering stage, only the necessary datasets are to be selected, based on the given data model and the business question in the picture (Analysis of content categories)
For a complete analysis, only the Content, Reaction and Reaction Type datasets are required.

The Content ID column connects the Content and the Reaction datasets. BY connecting the Type column in the Reaction and the ReactionTypes datasets, the Score (which quantifies popularity) for each Category can be obtained.

Data Cleaning
1.removing rows that have values which are missing,
2.changing the data type of some values within a column, and
3.removing columns which are not relevant to this task

Data Modelling — using Excel functions
1.Merging the three cleaned datasets using VLOOKUP.
2.Computing popularity scores for each content category using SUMIFS.

Task-3: DATA VISUALIZATION AND STORY TELLING

learn
1. How to connect the business and the data, and how to communicate relevant and engaging insights in a presentation.

To do
1. Choose the data visualizations that best support the story you want to tell to the client.
2. Create a PowerPoint presentation that reports on the client’s content performance, by filling in the template provided.

Task-4: PRESENTATION
learn
1. How to prepare for and present insights to a client in a presentation.
do
1. Record a < 10 minute video of your presentation to your client and internal team members.

Cnonclusion:
1. Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture.
2. Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions.
3. Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders.
